# WatsonX & Watson Assistant Capstone Project Infinite Learning Indonesia With IBM
Create a capstone project related to Watson and Watson Assistant, to be used as a Virtual Assistant on the Football Website Haloobarca.blogspot.com

# Problem
Most football news websites currently running are not modernized with Generative AI, so their functionality is limited.

# Solutions
My idea is to create a standard sports news website integrated with Generative AI using WatsonX & Watson Assistant. This is done to improve the performance of the website in terms of information related to the topics raised on the website.

This time I used the website "haloobarca.blogspot.com" a website that discusses football news related to FC Barcelona. By implementing Generative AI, users can not only read the news but can also get various information about FC Barcelona, ​​so they can increase the functionality of the website at one time.
