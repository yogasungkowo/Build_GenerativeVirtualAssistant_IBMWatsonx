# Setup the watson assistant was done, and we need to try that

https://github.com/yogasungkowo/Build_GenerativeVirtualAssistant_IBMWatsonx/assets/93362737/d9112085-2fd8-4213-8620-03e15c3fa84c

### We had some error, but if we check in error details

![Runtime error](https://github.com/yogasungkowo/Build_GenerativeVirtualAssistant_IBMWatsonx/assets/93362737/b75090a5-2643-4440-ba5f-1ae3adceb3b0)

### The main reason why its have error is in _[0].generated_text_ on step 8 variable to. I'll try to make changes like remove "[0].generated_text", the assistant not give me the error again, but repeat questions asked by customers.

![Not error](https://github.com/yogasungkowo/Build_GenerativeVirtualAssistant_IBMWatsonx/assets/93362737/bdb8dc2d-bda4-44a8-8cd7-4f2844ddbfaf)

### After try some many ways, the final conclusion is I'll still enter "[0].generated text" in step 8, this is done because the error does not appear when in the virtual assistant display on the website.
