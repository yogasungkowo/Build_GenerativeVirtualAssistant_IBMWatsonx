# Making Halo Barca Generative Virtual Assistan

After do some test integration between watsonx and watson assistant, we can move forward onto next topic. That's making our Generative Virtual Assistant for Halo Barca website
* Open your Watson Assistant and create new action same as previosly explained
* Create customer first say, in this step I define the customer input in the form of the alphabet a to z, and the word "Barca"
